# Product-Description
Here I have created a Product Description page using HTML &amp; CSS . The page consists of a navigation bar , banner,  product image, description of the project , prices of the various models and a button that takes you to a page with more images of the products

Output

  1.Main Page
  
 <img width="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Abdallah-Divkar/Product-Description/assets/67052449/350d9e1c-b4e9-4792-b7bc-352f2193e873">

2. When we click the "View Larger Picture Button" it opens up anew page with more images
